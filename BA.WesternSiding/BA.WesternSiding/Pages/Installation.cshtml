                    <strong>Installers are the key to a great job!</strong>
                    <br />
                    What you see when you look at your home is the quality of the work done by the person who did the job. If they are true craftsmen, the fit and finish of your job will stand out. Conversely if they are not, it will stick out like a sore thumb. That is why we are very careful about who we hire and let work on your home. We track their work with a customer satisfaction survey that asks our customers about the overall quality and all of our employees consistently score in the excellent range. Frankly, we wouldn't have it any other way.
                </p>

                    <br />
                    Lets face it, most large remodeling jobs are an inconvenience to you and your family. At Western Siding we try to minimize this in every way possible. It all starts with our installers. They are all friendly, hard working and conscientious. They work with you to determine the best material storage and work area locations. They keep the jobsite clean and safe. They work on your job every work day until the job is finished. They also work full days to minimize the total time it takes to complete your job. These are NOT 10-2 workmen. Again we know this because we ask all of our customers to rate them on attendance and job site cleanliness. And we reward our employees for excellence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What this means to you</strong>
                    <br />
                    There are a lot of companies you can choose for your home improvement projects. We at Western want you to be happy you chose us. Over the last 40 years we have learned that the most important factor in creating satisfied customers is the installation crews we send out to do the work. We are extremely confident in saying, when it comes to our installers we have the best in the business. You want to be a happy customer we know how to make you one.
