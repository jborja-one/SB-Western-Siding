                        <h2>Installers are Key to Successful Projects</h2>
                       The end quality of your home at the completion of a project is determined by the quality of work done by the individual or team. If they are true craftsmen, the fit and finish of your project will standout amongst others. Conversely, if the team is not, your project will stick out poorly.
                       <br/>
                       That’s why we are so careful about who we hire and allow to work on your home or business. We track all our employees’ work with a customer satisfaction survey that asks our customers about the overall quality of the job and our team consistently scores excellently. Frankly, we wouldn’t have it any other way.
                       <br/>

                        Let’s be honest, most large remodeling jobs are an inconvenience to you, your family or business. At Western Siding we try to minimize this in every way possible. 
                        <br/>
                        Everything starts with our installers. They are all friendly, hardworking, and conscientious. Our dedicated team works with you to determine the best material storage and work area locations. We ensure all jobsites are clean and safe. 
                        <br/>
                        Our crews work full business days until the job is completed in full to minimize the total time it takes to complete the project. Our team is not comprised of 10am to 2pm workmen. We know this because we ask all our customers to rate them on attendance and job site cleanliness. We reward our employees for excellence based on these surveys.
                    </p>
