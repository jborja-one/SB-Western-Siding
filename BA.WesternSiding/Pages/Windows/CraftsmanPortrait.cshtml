                    <p>
                        ProVia has developed a reputation within the vinyl replacement window industry for developing
                        the best vinyl windows - ones that provide a high degree of customization combined with
                        outstanding quality and energy efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the energy-efficient Endure line, ProVia has chosen the optimum levels of technology to make
                        a window that will work continually at peak performance. Endure replacement windows provide all
                        that you would expect from high-performance ENERGY STAR certified vinyl windows, using much less
                        energy to stay warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and provide more comfort all year round.
                        These windows are extremely durable with energy-efficient window construction, and an
                        innovative, multi-chambered frame and sash design, triple weatherstripping and ComforTech™ Warm
                        Edge Glazing, a high-tech glass package that measurably improves thermal performance—for less
                        heat loss, warmer glass temperatures and reduced interior condensation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Endure vinyl windows are one of three ProVia window lines that meet ENERGY STAR window standards
                        nationwide or for specific climate zones.
                    </p>
